（目前还没有考虑有多个人连接度相同的情况）
6.找出通过他而结识的朋友对最多
思路：出现几次就有几个朋友对，因此连接度最高的人即为朋友最多的人
==找出某个字段，该字段在整个熟人表里出现次数最多
SQL语句:


select friend1 as person,count(*)
as counts
from acquaintance
group by friend1
union
select friend2 as person,count(*)
as counts
from acquaintance
group by friend2
order by counts desc
limit 1
;



















和找出每个类别里朋友最多的人很像
select friend1,friend2
from acquaintance
where(

//想要得到的是
1 几次
2 几次
//先把这两个合并起来
select friend1 as personoccur
from acquaintance
union
select friend2
from acquaintance;

select friend1,friend2
from acquaintance
group by friend1,friend2
having count(*)=
(select top1 count(*)
as counts
from acquaintance
group by friend1,friend2
order by counts desc);


//选出该列中某个人出现几次
+选出全部中某个人出现几次

select friend1,friend2
from acquaintance
group by friend1,friend2
having count(*)=
(
select friend1 as person,count(*)
as counts
from acquaintance
group by friend1
union
select friend2 as person,count(*)
as counts
from acquaintance
group by friend2
order by counts desc
limit 1
)
;


//实验
select 
select counts(*),friend1 as person,friend2 as person
from acuquaintance
group by friend1,friend2
order by counts desc;



//实验：
select friend1 as personoccur
from acquaintance

select personoccur,count * from 

4.找出每个类别里都有朋友的人

找出每个类别里朋友





1.找出互不认识的人

///最终:找出整个表格中哪个数据出现的次数最多
select friend1
from acquaintance
group by friend1
having count(*)=
(
select count(*)
as counts
from acquaintance
group by friend1
union
select count(*)
as counts
from acquaintance
group by friend2
order by counts desc
limit 1
);

找到这个最多次数



insert into test values(1,'a');
insert into test values(1,'b');
insert into test values(1,'f');
insert into test values(2,'c');
insert into test values(2,'d');
insert into test values(3,'e');


select count(*)
as counts
from acquaintance


group by friend1
union
select count(*)
as counts
from acquaintance
group by friend2
order by counts desc
limit 1;
