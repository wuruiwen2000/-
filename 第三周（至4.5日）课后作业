找出每类朋友最多的人






//找出只在一个类别里面出现的人
with cte as(
select friend1 as person,relationship
from acquaintance
union
select friend2,relationship
from acquaintance
)
select set from cte t1 where not exists
(select * from cte where set=t1.set
and relationship<>t1.relationship);

//将两个select联合起来
select friend1 as person,relationship
from acquaintance
union
select friend2 as person,relationship
from acquaintance;

//从中选出person来
with cte as(
select friend1 as person,relationship
from acquaintance
union
select friend2,relationship
from acquaintance)
select person from cte;

select friend1 as person
from acquaintance
where (select friend1 as person,relationship
from acquaintance
union
select friend2,relationship
from acquaintance);

with table1 as
(select friend1 as person,relationship
from acquaintance

select friend2,relationship
from acquaintance)
select * from table1
where table1=friend;

//创建临时表
create temporary table table1 as
(
select friend1 as person,relationship
from acquaintance,
select friend2,relationship
from acquaintance
);

select person 
from table1
where
//relationship的数量只有1


//查找每个人对应的relationship的数量
select count(relationship)
from table1;

create temporary tabe table2 as
(
select person
from table1
where



//得出表后找到一个人有几种类别
select count(relationship)
from table1
where 





create temporary table table1 as
(
select friend1 as person,relationship
from acquaintance
);

select friend2,relationship
into ##table1(person,relationship)
from acquaintance;



//先解决查找数量的问题
create temporary table table2 as
(select friend2 as person,relationship
from acquaintance);



//如果class不同
//首先需要有两个表
create temporary table table2_copy as
(select friend2 as person,relationship
from acquaintance);

create temporary table table1_copy as
(select friend1 as person,relationship
from acquaintance);

//选择不能有不同class的地方

select person
from table2
where not exists(
select * from table2
where person=table2_copy.person
and
relationship!=table2_copy.relationship);


select person
from table1_copy
where not exists(
select * from table1_copy
where person=table1.person
and
relationship!=table1.relationship);




select relationship
from table2.copy

select person
from table2
where
person=table2_copy.person





;

##//第二步：
将其放入一个表中
(两种方法）
1.创建表
create temporary table table_temp
(
person varchar(10),
relationship varchar(5));
2.插入数据
insert into table_temp
(
select friend1,relationship
from acquaintance
);
insert into table_temp
(
select friend2,relationship
from acquaintance
);

//第三步：
从表中找出class不相同的
1.构造相同的表(其中一个必须是长期的而非暂时的）
create table table_temp_copy
(
person varchar(10),
relationship varchar(5));
insert into table_temp_copy
(
select friend1,relationship
from acquaintance
);
insert into table_temp_copy
(
select friend2,relationship
from acquaintance
);

create table table_temp
(
person varchar(10),
relationship varchar(5));
insert into table_temp
(
select friend1,relationship
from acquaintance
);
insert into table_temp
(
select friend2,relationship
from acquaintance
);
2.开始select
select person 
from table_temp
where not exists
(
select * from table_temp
where 
person=table_temp_copy.person
and 
relationship!=table_temp_copy.relationship)
;

create temporary table temp_table
(select friend1 as person,relationship
from acquaintance,
union
select friend2,relationship
from acquaintance);


//全换成正常表试试
第一个表：t
create table t
(
person varchar(10),
relationship varchar(5));
insert into t
(
select friend1,relationship
from acquaintance
);
insert into t
(
select friend2,relationship
from acquaintance
);
第二个表:t1
create table t1
(
person varchar(10),
relationship varchar(5));
insert into t1
(
select friend1,relationship
from acquaintance
);
insert into t1
(
select friend2,relationship
from acquaintance
);
开始比较：
select person 
from t
where not exists
(
select * from t
where 
t.person=t1.person
and 
relationship!=t1.relationship)
;
